## Overview

**KoboBifrost Upload** is a web application built using **Streamlit** that simplifies the process of updating survey data from an Excel file to a specified Kobotoolbox project. This tool was developed to address the inefficiencies and challenges faced during manual data entry, particularly when dealing with repetitive metadata and large datasets.

## History and Motivation

While working as a consultant agricultural engineer at the **CIMMYT** [**CSISA**](https://csisa.org/) project stationed in **Nepalgunj**, our primary platform for data collection and forms management was **Kobotoolbox**. Our routine reporting required us to collect and enter data from project beneficiaries into the Kobotoolbox platform.

### The Problem

- **Repetitive Metadata Entry**: Each data submission required filling out the same metadata fields (e.g., project name, duty station, beneficiary type) repeatedly.
- **Slow Progress**: Due to the lengthy forms and repetitive nature of the metadata, our trainees could only enter about **50 data points per person**.
- **Time Constraints**: Our team had other critical tasks, but the data entry process was consuming too much of our time.

### The Turning Point

I realized that entering data on a spreadsheet would be much faster, especially for repeated data, as we could simply drag and copy cells. This led me to explore the **Kobotoolbox API** for a more efficient solution.

### The Solution

As the only team member with Python skills at the time, I wrote a simple script to automate the data submission process. This script allowed us to enter data into an Excel file and then upload it to Kobotoolbox, significantly increasing our efficiency to **120+ submissions per person**.

However, the script was not user-friendly for others on the team. To make it accessible, I converted the script into a **Streamlit application**, enabling the entire team to use it without needing to understand or modify the code.

## Project Limitations

While KoboBifrost Upload has been a valuable tool, it does have some limitations:

- **No Support for Repeat Groups**: The application currently does not support repeat groups and nested groups in the data.
- **No Media Support**: Media files are not supported in the current version.
- **Other Limitations**: There are additional features and functionalities that could be added to enhance the tool further.

Despite these limitations, KoboBifrost Upload has been a significant stepping stone in my journey into the world of **ODK (Open Data Kit)** solutions.
