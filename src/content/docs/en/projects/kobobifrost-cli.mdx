## Introduction

**KoboBifrost CLI** is a powerful command-line tool designed to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations efficiently and in a streamlined manner. If you've ever worked with Kobotoolbox and XLS forms, you know how repetitive and time-consuming some tasks can be. KoboBifrost CLI aims to simplify these processes, making your workflow faster and more efficient.

## Why I Created KoboBifrost CLI

Working with Kobotoolbox often involves repetitive tasks, especially when preparing and updating XLS forms. If you are from humanitarian organization, NGOs/INGOs or working on any research project that required working with the XLSForm and Kobotoolbox there is a chance you may feel the same thing. During my time at CIMMYT, we frequently worked with XLS form from creation and deployment to maintenance of XLSForms. After a while I felt the process was often slow and cumbersome. I started to look for any existing CLIs for kobotoolbox and unfortunately I didn't find any.
Since I had been learning about the Kobotoolbox's api and experienced using it while developing [[KoboBifrost Upload]] I took it upon myself to develop it and implement on my workflow.

### The Problem

1. **Creating a New XLS Form locally:**
   - You either start with a blank form, reuse an older project, or create a template.

2. **Form development and Validation:**
   - XLS forms can get messy specially working with thousand of rows in XLSForm, and there's always a chance of missing a group closure, accidental group components requiring conditional formatting.

3. **Project Creation at Kobotoolbox server and Preview:**
   - Navigate to the Kobotoolbox site, create a project on server, upload the XLS form, and preview it.
   - If unsatisfied, edit the XLS form and repeat the process, a tedious and time-consuming task.

4. **Deployment and Testing:**
   - After testing, deploy the form and perform a test survey before final implementation.

### The Inspiration

If you've used Git's CLI, you know how convenient it is to create a project, make changes, and push those changes with just a few commands. I wanted a similar experience for Kobotoolbox. So, I started exploring how Git works and began building KoboBifrost CLI.

## The Solution

### Step 1 and 2: Creating Local XLS Form Project and Conditional formatting

- **`bifrost init`**
  - Creates a blank XLS form project.
  - Optionally, you can enable conditional formatting at the start.

### Step 3: Creation and Preview

- **`bifrost create -ps`**
  - Creates a project on the Kobotoolbox server and opens a preview form.

### Step 3: Update and Preview

- **`bifrost update -ps`**
  - Updates the form and opens a preview of the current asset / form.

### Step 4: Deploy

- **`bifrost deploy`**
  - Deploys the form.
  - You can also redeploy using `-d` in the create command and `-d` and `-rd` in the update command.

## Behind the Scenes

KoboBifrost CLI creates a `.bifrost` folder when you initialize, create, update, deploy, or redeploy. This folder contains files updated with information like:

- **Asset ID:** The ID of your XLS project.
- **Filepath:** The location where the XLS form is stored on your local device.
- **Download Path:** If you export data or assets.

The API Key and API URL required for project authorization are handled by the keyring of your operating system.

## Features

KoboBifrost CLI allows you to perform the following actions:

- **Create** new projects.
- **Update** existing forms.
- **Deploy** and **redeploy** forms.
- **Preview** forms.
- **Export** data.
- **Copy permissions** from another project.
- **Enable submission** without authorization feature.
- **Delete** projects.
- **Export assets** (<Badge text="XLSForm"/> or <Badge text="XForm"/> ).
- **Export project data** in CSV and XLSX format.

<Aside type="caution" title="Doesn't support version control">
  Currently It's just a CLI and doesnot has version control feature for XLSx
  files. If you know any opensource project for the version control of XLSx
  files feel free to reach out, I would really love adding it in my workflow.
