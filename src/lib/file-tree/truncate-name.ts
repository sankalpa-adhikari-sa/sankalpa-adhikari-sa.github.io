/**
 * Truncate an over-long filename for display while keeping its extension,
 * so a 150-character name renders as `start…name.ext` rather than being
 * clipped mid-word with the extension lost.
 *
 * - Names at or under `max` are returned unchanged.
 * - The extension is the text after the last dot, but only when that dot
 *   isn't the first character (so dotfiles like `.gitignore` are treated
 *   as having no extension) and isn't the trailing character.
 * - Extensionless and dotfile names are truncated with a trailing ellipsis
 *   and no preserved suffix.
 *
 * The full name should still be exposed elsewhere (e.g. a `title`
 * attribute) so nothing is lost to a reader who wants it.
